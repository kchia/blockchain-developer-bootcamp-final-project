## Installation
### Prerequisites

- Node.js v.14+
- Truffle
- Ganache
- Yarn

### Running the project locally

In the project root, you can run `yarn install` to install the frontend and smart contract dependencies.

Then run `yarn start`, which concurrently runs the app in the development mode, starts a REST API at `http://localhost:3004`, and populates the local blockchain with test data.\

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Repo Structure

- `/src`
  - `/api`
    - `client.js`: a client wrapper around the Fetch API that supports `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests
  - `/app`: contains the top-level component for the application
    - `/layout`
      - `/footer`: contains the `Footer` component and css file
      - `/header`: contains the `Header` component and css file
      - `/navigation`: contains the `Navigation` component and css file
      - `index.js`: defines and exports the `Layout` component, which contains the routing for the application
      - `layout.module.css`
    - `index.js`: exports the `App` component, which can render different layouts
    - `store.js`: configures and exports the Redux store
  - `/common`: contains code used across components annd throughout the application
    - `/constants`: contains shared constants (e.g., `STATUS.idle`)
    - `/core`: contains generic components (e.g., `Button`, `Modal`, `Loader`, etc.)
    - `/utils`: contains utility functions (e.g., `formatNumber()`)
  - `/features`: contains the code for the main features of the application
    - `/no-match`
      - `index.js`
    - `index.js`: exports the components from the `/features` folder
  - `/styles`
    - `global.css`: contains global css styles used throughout the application
  - `index.js`: entry point to the React Application
  - `setupTests.js`: import any additional libraries used to extend test functionality (e.g, `jest-dom`)
- `.env`: contains environment variables (typically added to `.gitignore`)
- `db.json`: JSON database for your fake REST API
- `routes.json`: routing logic for your fake REST API

The following principles were applied in the design of the folder structure:

- A consistent and predictable naming convention makes it relatively easy to locate needed files and understand where new files should be created. Each feature contains sub-folders that represent a CRUD operation for that feature (e.g., `/create`, `/edit`).

- All files related to a component (e.g., component, test, and css files) are kept together under a single folder so it's easy to find and update the code for a given feature.

- The service abstracts away the API logic for each feature, thereby avoiding the need to hard-code the API calls into the components directly.

- Core UI components such as Button, Form, List, etc. are kept in a separate directory (i.e., `src/common/core`). As the UI library continues to grow, the core UI library could be packaged for use in another project or published as part of Storybook. Some developers on the team can even focus on this directory only.

## Other Available Scripts

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
